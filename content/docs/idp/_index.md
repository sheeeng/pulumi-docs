    Pulumi IDP provides infrastructure building blocks that platform teams publish and developers consume. Platform teams author templates and components that codify organizational standards, then publish them to a private registry. Developers scaffold infrastructure from templates, compose components in code, or deploy directly from the console.

    The platform supports Day 0 through Day 2 operations: establishing golden paths, provisioning infrastructure, and maintaining deployed resources.
